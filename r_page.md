# R

R is a statistical program/environment that can be used for statistical modeling or analysis.
More information about R can be found on its [About](http://www.r-project.org/about.html) page
on its [homepage](http://www.r-project.org/).

Apart from the excellent documentation that can be found on R project's page, below are
some of the links that I find useful.

- [UCLA Academic Technology Services page related to R](https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/r/)
- [Prof. D. G. Rossiter's page (See under "R applications")](http://www.css.cornell.edu/faculty/dgr2/)
- [Hadley Wickham's pages related to R and other statistics courses he teaches](http://hadley.nz/)
- [Advanced R](http://adv-r.hadley.nz/) -- by Hadley Wickham (a very useful resource!)
- [Geographic Data Analysis Using R](http://geog.uoregon.edu/geogr/)
- [How R Searches and Finds Stuff](http://obeautifulcode.com/R/How-R-Searches-And-Finds-Stuff/) -- very useful!!

## If you cannot avoid using Excel

Patrick Burns's ["Spreadsheet Addiction"](http://www.burns-stat.com/pages/Tutor/spreadsheet_addiction.html) lists some common problems
associated with Excel.
He also has many tutorials pertaining to R under the "Tutorial" title on his page ([link](http://www.burns-stat.com)).
